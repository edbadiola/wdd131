            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p><strong>Reanalen Cabigayan</strong> is a dedicated health and wellness advocate from <strong>Tacloban City</strong>.
                She founded the <strong>Barangay Wellness Hub</strong> with the aim of guiding individuals towards a healthier and
                more balanced life. Her vision is to make wellness accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or
                circumstances. Through this initiative, she strives to promote a sustainable and natural approach to health that
                focuses on long-term well-being rather than quick fixes.</p>
            
            <p>Her mission is to empower others by sharing valuable knowledge about natural healing, proper nutrition, and
                self-care. She believes that true wellness is a combination of mental, physical, and emotional health, and she works
                tirelessly to educate her community on how to maintain this balance. Over the years, she has helped many families
                and communities embrace a lifestyle that prioritizes wellness, using natural remedies and high-quality wellness
                products. By encouraging individuals to take charge of their health, she aims to create a more holistic approach to
                living a fulfilling life.</p>
